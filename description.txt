This mod adds a few little features to Terraria.
Some of them inspired by version 1.4.
Everything is configurable.

[v0.1] - using Ctrl in inventory moves item to trash or shop, Shift only moves to chest
       - ruler is available any time
[v0.2] - dynamic camera (inspired by dynamic camera option in Terraria Overhaul)
[v0.3] - chest switcher (hotkeys to switch to left/right chest from currently opened)
[v0.4] - added Shift-Right-Click on item slot to take half
[v0.5] - fixed mod unload
[v0.6] - fixed crash when Dynamic Camera is either enabled or set to zero
