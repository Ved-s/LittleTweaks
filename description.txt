This mod adds a few little features to Terraria.
Some of them inspired by version 1.4.
Everything is configurable.

 - using Ctrl in inventory moves item to trash or shop, Shift only moves to chest
 - ruler is available any time
 - dynamic camera (inspired by dynamic camera option in Terraria Overhaul)
